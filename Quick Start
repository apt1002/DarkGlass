Quick Start
###

   * Navigation of a [Wiki|wiki] is just like any other web site.
   * Click on the edit page link in the navigation bar to edit a page. The page's text will come up in an edit box; edit and preview it until you're happy, and finally save it. This causes an update to be sent to the webmaster.
   * To add a new page, add a link to it on an existing page. Links are written in \[square brackets\].
   * To find out how to do a particular sort of formatting, follow the link on the edit page to [DarkGlass Text Formatting].
   * If anything is unclear, try the [DarkGlass FAQ], and if that fails, $email{email the webmaster}.
   * See [DarkGlass Use] for full user instructions.
