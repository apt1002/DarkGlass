# DarkGlass Templates

The layout of the DarkGlass pages can be customized by editing `view.html`. The only other language-dependent text is in `notfound.html`.

Some other templates are used by particular macros, and are documented with the corresponding macro in [DarkGlass Macros](DarkGlass Macros.md).
