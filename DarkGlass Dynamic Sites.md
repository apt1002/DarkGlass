## DarkGlass Dynamic Sites

In order to run DarkGlass dynamically, you need access to a web server capable of running [Perl](https://www.perl.org) CGI scripts. If you’re not sure what some of that means, you’re probably not ready to install DarkGlass yourself, and you should seek help (e.g. do some web searches to learn about web servers and CGI scripts, or ask the person who runs your web server for help).
