DarkGlass Installation
###

In order to run [DarkGlass], you need access to a web server capable of running [http://www.perl.org|Perl] CGI scripts (Perl 5.8.7 or later). If you're not sure what some of that means, you're probably not ready to install DarkGlass yourself, and you should seek help (e.g. do some web searches to learn about web servers and CGI scripts, or ask the person who runs your web server for help).

To install DarkGlass:

   1 Unpack the [Getting DarkGlass|distribution archive].
   2 Copy the contents of the @cgi-bin@ directory into the CGI program directory of your web server.
   3 Configure the @web.pl@ script as described in [DarkGlass Configuration].
   4 The wiki should now be ready to use. See [DarkGlass Customization] for details of the various ways in which [DarkGlass] can be customized.

See [DarkGlass Organisation] for more details of the layout of the files and URLs used by DarkGlass.
