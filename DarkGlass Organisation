DarkGlass Organisation
###

Distribution
===

The [Getting DarkGlass|distribution archive] is organised as follows:

   <@README@> is a quick introduction.
   <@cgi-bin@>contains the main DarkGlass program @DarkGlass.pm@, some helper modules in @VCS@ and @RRT@, and the front-end script and configuration file @wiki.pl@.
   <@text@>contains the contents of the wiki, which is initially just the DarkGlass documentation. Pages can be locked by making them read-only; this can be helpful to make sure that a wiki's home page, at least, is safe from defacement. It can also be useful for other sensitive information such as CVs.

URLs
===

[DarkGlass]'s use of URLs mirrors the structure of the files it uses on disk, but almost all URLs within the wiki are generated by [DarkGlass Macros|macros] such as a link to a file or image.
