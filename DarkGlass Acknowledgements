DarkGlass Acknowledgements

DarkGlass is derived from my wiki, [http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/Wiklet|Wiklet], whose early versions were based on [http://www.object-arts.co.uk/wiki/html/Dolphin/FrontPage.htm|DolphinWiki], which in turn was derived from the original [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki|WikiWikiWeb]. Alistair Turnbull gave invaluable criticism of its design, code and documentation, and tested early versions as a user and webmaster. Catherine Heyrendt was the first person other than me to use Wiklet to run a web site, and gave valuable feedback on the installation process, as well as finding bugs and requesting useful features.
