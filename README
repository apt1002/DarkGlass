DarkGlass is a simple content management system that exports a
directory tree to the web. It displays different file types
appropriately, uses file permissions to determine which files and
directories should be exported, and has a customizable navigation
panel and a simple wiki-esque markup language for rapid creation of
simple web pages.

A future version will support wiki-like editing.

DarkGlass is meant to be simple to use, simple to install and
maintain, and its code should be easy to understand. It is released
under the GNU GPL. There is no warranty.
