DarkGlass Navigation
###

The navigation bar contains:

   * Appropriate links to other parts of the web site, usually including a breadcrumb trail at the top to show where you are.
   * An _Edit Page_ link, which lets you edit the current page's text. The text can be marked up as described in [DarkGlass Text Formatting].
