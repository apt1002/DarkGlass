DarkGlass Macros
###

Macros are special markup which allow things that are not otherwise possible. A macro call is written @\$macro@ if the macro takes no arguments, or @\$macro\{arg_1_,...,arg_n_\}@ if it does. Commas in macro arguments must be escaped with backslashes. Unwanted arguments may be omitted.

Macros are evaluated after [Smut Text Formatting|Smut markup], which means that they do not work in certain places, for example as part of a link.

   <@\$scripturl@>The URL of the DarkGlass script.
   <@\$homepage@>The name of the web site's $link{$browse{$homepage},home page}, suitable for displaying as text.
   <@\$page@>The current page, escaped suitably for use in a URL.
   <@\$pagename@>The name of the current page, suitable for displaying as text.
   <@\$lastmodified@>The date on which the current page was last modified.
   <@\$url\{_path_\}@>Make a URL from a site-relative path.
   <@\$include\{_file_\}@>Inserts the contents of the given HTML or text file from the templates directory. If the file does not exist, an @abort.htm@ error message is shown with \$text set from @nofile.txt@.
   <@\$link{_url_,_description_}@>Produces a link to the given URL whose displayed text is @_description_@.
   <@\$filesize{_file_}@>Inserts the size of the given file in the download directory.
   <@\$image{_image_,_width_,_height}@>Inserts the given image, which may be either a local file in the @image@ directory or a URL. The width and height are in pixels, or a percentage of the available space. If no width and height is given, and the image is a local image, the thumbnail is inserted instead, if any, and made a link to the image itself.
   <@\$imagecomment{_image_}@>Inserts the given image's comment, if any.
   <@\$webfile{_file_,_format_}@>Produces a link to the given file in the download directory whose text is @_format_@, followed by the size of the file.
   <@\$pdfpages{_file_}@>Inserts the number of pages in the given PDF file in the download directory.
   <@\$email{_text_}@>Makes @_text_@ a link to send mail to the administrator (see [DarkGlass Configuration]).
